# PAExecWorkingDirectoryDemo
A simple batch file demonstration of where PAExec.exe copies your files when using the -clist option.

To get this working in your environment, open Go.bat and modify the [YourComputerName], [YourUserName] and [YourPassword] fields such that they contain the proper values. Then run Go.bat and watch the magic (sort of) happen!
